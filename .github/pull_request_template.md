## Summary

<!-- What problem does this change solve? -->

## Validation

<!-- List exact commands/scenarios, toolchain, and results. Distinguish repository checks, source smokes, and exact signed-artifact/physical-client qualification; mark non-applicable checks explicitly. -->

## Security and privacy impact
