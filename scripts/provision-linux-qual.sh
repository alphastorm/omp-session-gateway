#
# Linux qualification lane: one throwaway DigitalOcean droplet, release and OMP evidence.
#
# Why this exists. The original Linux evidence in docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md came from a Debian 13
# aarch64 container. A container shares the host kernel, never boots, has no public address of its
# own, and its `systemd --user` manager exists only because something outside kept it alive. That is
# enough to prove an install/uninstall sequence and file permissions, and nothing else. Five things
# a container structurally cannot show are the point of this script:
#
#   1. a real machine lifecycle: its own kernel, its own boot, its own public IP;
#   2. reboot and login persistence;
#   3. a denied Tailscale identity;
#   4. signed-candidate install/doctor/uninstall with checksum and provenance verification; and
#   5. the mandatory exact mainline OMP build, activation, publication, launch, and revocation path.
#
# Two design decisions are worth knowing before editing this file.
#
# Lingering versus a login session. The gateway's systemd unit is `WantedBy=default.target` and the
# CLI never calls `loginctl enable-linger`. So "the service came back after reboot" is ambiguous by
# default: it can mean lingering started the user manager at boot, or it can mean the SSH login used
# to check created a session that pulled in default.target. This script resolves the ambiguity by
# rebooting twice and measuring from *root only*, so the qualified user has zero sessions at the
# instant of measurement. With lingering off the daemon must be absent; with lingering on it must be
# present while `loginctl` reports no session for that user, and its process age must track system
# uptime rather than the age of our connection. Both numbers are printed, every time.
#
# Tagged identity. The droplet joins the tailnet with a *tagged* auth key. Tailscale Serve populates
# `Tailscale-User-Login` only for user-owned source devices, so a request from a tagged node arrives
# with no user identity at all and the gateway must fail closed. That is the denial half the ledger
# needs and it cannot be produced from the operator's own devices. The price of a tagged node is that
# it can never present a user identity, so `doctor` cannot pass every check on it and the allowed half has
# to come from the operator's workstation, which is a genuinely distinct user-owned node. Both are
# measured here. See docs/LINUX_QUALIFICATION.md for exactly what each pass does and does not prove.
#
# Secrets. The DigitalOcean token and the Tailscale auth key are read from the environment and never
# appear in argv, in cloud-init user data (which is readable from the droplet's own metadata service
# and from the DigitalOcean API), or in any printed line. The auth key is streamed over stdin into a
# mode-0600 file that a remote EXIT trap removes, and `tailscale login` reads it with the documented
# `file:` form. The service's one-time readiness nonce is redacted where ExecStart is printed.
#
# The image is a parameter. OMP_QUAL_IMAGE defaults to the same `debian-13-x64` slug this lane has
# always used, and also accepts a numeric DigitalOcean *custom image* id. Custom images have no slug,
# so a purely numeric value is the only shape an imported image can take and the distinction needs no
# second knob. That exists for one reason: the Linux service backend in apps/gateway/src/service.ts
# builds a systemd user unit for every `linux` platform and then drives `systemctl --user`, with no
# check on what init system is actually running. Whether systemd-only is acceptable for alpha is a
# decision, and the cheapest input to it is to point this lane at a non-systemd distribution and read
# the failure. OMP_QUAL_INIT=openrc provisions an imported Alpine image and runs lane `init`, whose
# expected result is a *refused* install that leaves nothing running. See docs/LINUX_QUALIFICATION.md
# §10 for the import procedure; no OpenRC service backend is implemented here and none should be
# inferred from this lane passing.
#
# Cost. One `s-2vcpu-8gb-amd` droplet, one fixed name, reused rather than duplicated. The EXIT trap
# always reprints the destroy command, because the only way this lane becomes expensive is by being
# forgotten. An imported custom image is a *second* billable resource and `destroy` deliberately does
# not delete it, so `destroy` lists every user image in the account and names the delete command.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/provision-linux-qual.sh provision
#   scripts/provision-linux-qual.sh qualify [lane...]
#   scripts/provision-linux-qual.sh status
#   scripts/provision-linux-qual.sh destroy
#
# Lanes, systemd: host artifact lifecycle omp migration rollback identity persistence uninstall
#                 (default: all). `omp` builds and exercises exact mainline discovery/query;
#                 `migration` stops before crossing gateway architectures; `rollback` measures
#                 stopped target selection, incompatible activation compensation, and signed
#                 predecessor reinstall using the archive roots left by `migration`.
# Lanes, OpenRC:  host artifact init (default: all three; the rest presume a working install).

# The Alpine/OpenRC variant. Four deliberate differences from the systemd user data above, each of
# which is a property of the distribution rather than a preference:
#
#   * `bash` is a package here, and `remote()` runs `bash -s`. `coreutils` and `grep` replace the
#     busybox applets whose option sets differ (`stat -c`, `grep -c`), and `libstdc++` is what Bun's
#     musl build links against.
#   * the qualified user's login shell is `/bin/ash`, not `/bin/bash`. cloud-init creates users in
#     `cloud_init_modules` and installs packages later in `cloud_config_modules`, so naming a shell
#     that does not exist yet leaves the account unusable in between. `remote()` asks for `bash`
#     explicitly, so the login shell does not need to be it.
#   * `disable_root: false` is stated rather than assumed. The lane logs in as root to measure, and
#     an imported image's `cloud.cfg` is not ours to trust on that point.

# `systemctl --user daemon-reload`, `enable`, and `start`. Nothing in that path inspects the init
# system, so on an OpenRC host `install` cannot succeed. This lane exists because "cannot succeed" has
# two very different shapes and the ledger needs to know which one is real: a refusal that leaves the
# machine as it found it, or a partial install that reports failure while leaving a token, a staged
# runtime, and possibly a listener behind.
#
# A NON-ZERO install exit is therefore the expected, successful outcome of this lane. Only three things
# are asserted, and each is a safety property rather than a message: the install refused, no gateway
# process survives, and nothing is listening. Everything else — the verbatim message, the residue, and
# how `status`, `doctor`, and `uninstall` behave afterwards — is measured and printed for the lead to
# read, because those are the findings, and asserting a predicted answer would hide a surprise.
#
# This lane implements no OpenRC backend and its passing must not be read as OpenRC being supported.
