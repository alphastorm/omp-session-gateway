/**
 * Runs the repository test suite on the current host OS, minus the files that are bound to another
 * host. `portable-source` runs this on Linux, macOS, and Windows for every change, so a new test is
 * cross-platform by default: excluding one takes an entry here, with its platform and reason.
 *
 * An exclusion means "cannot run unchanged on this OS", never "flaky": nothing here retries, and a
 * file that fails anywhere it is not excluded fails the job.
