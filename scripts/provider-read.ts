/**
 * Qualification drives third-party control planes (Vultr, Tailscale, Scaleway) whose APIs answer an
 * occasional transient 5xx or transport failure. Vultr returned HTTP 502 twice in one day: once at Windows admission, and
 * once on the instance lookup after the lane's reboot, which failed the attempt with its VM running.
 * On 2026-09-29 it returned 502 to three reads spanning six seconds while the lane staged its guest,
 * so reads now back off 2, 4, 8 and 16 seconds, about half a minute in all.
 * A read is idempotent, so it gets a bounded retry. A create, change, or delete never comes through
 * here, because a write that reached the provider must not run twice. HTTP and thrown network
 * failures share five attempts; the last response is returned or the last error is thrown.
 * Programming errors and caller cancellation are final. Each caller keeps its own status handling.
