/**
 * Patterns for personal and infrastructure identifiers that must not enter this public repository.
 *
 * This is a sibling of `capability-leak-rules.ts`, which guards secrets. This file guards a
 * different class: values that are not credentials but still identify a person, a machine, or a
 * private network. Nothing here would grant access; publishing it is a privacy failure rather than
 * a security one, which is exactly why it is easy to be careless with.
 *
 * It exists because I published a workstation hostname, a phone's hardware serial, a home directory
 * path, a private tailnet address, a tailnet node id, and a production VPS address into a public
 * repository and its pull requests, then had to rewrite history and delete three releases to get
 * them back out. Every one of those was avoidable by a reviewer noticing. A check does not get
 * tired.
 *
 * The rules are shape-based rather than a denylist of known values. A denylist only catches the
 * values already leaked, which is precisely the set that no longer matters.
