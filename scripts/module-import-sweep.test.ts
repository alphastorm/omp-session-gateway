/**
 * Imports every server-side source module once.
 *
 * Two purposes, both real. First, Bun's coverage only instruments what a test actually loads, so a
 * module no test imports is absent from the lcov entirely rather than reported at 0%. That makes the
 * headline percentage flatter itself by omission, and — worse — hides the existence of untested
 * files. Importing them all turns silence into an honest row. It does mean import-time lines count as
 * covered, which flatters the number slightly in the other direction; that trade is deliberate,
 * because a visible low number beats an invisible file.
 *
 * Second, and independently useful: this is a smoke test that every module is import-safe. A module
 * that throws, blocks, binds a port, or writes to disk merely by being loaded is a real defect —
 * `cli.ts` is only safe to import because its entry point sits behind `import.meta.main` — and
 * without this nothing would catch a top-level side effect until a service failed to start.
 *
 * Scope is server-side deliberately. `apps/web/src` touches `document` and service-worker globals at
 * import time and is exercised by the Playwright suite instead, and
 * `packages/collab-client/upstream` is pinned upstream source that this repository does not own.
